                                    Software is no longer just a means of supporting a business;
                                    it is now an intrinsic part of it. Businesses communicate
                                    with their customers using software that is supplied as online
                                    services or applications and may be used on a variety of devices.

                                    them do that. DevOps breaks down boundaries between two traditionally
                                    separate teams: development and operations. It helps to automate and
                                    streamline software development and infrastructure management procedures
                                    thereby enabling organizations to innovate faster. A shift from traditional

                                    brings in automation to speed up processes that have historically
                                    been manual and slow.
